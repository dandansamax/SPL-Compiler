## How to develop

It is a good habit to pull branchs every time you try to modify the codes.

To be convinient, you can switch to a new branch *feature* in local git when you want to add new features. 
After completing, you can merge the branch to main and push it to github. \( doesn't matter if you don't want.\)

We should make sure that the remote main branch always runs correctly.
